		service_status.py is used to detrmine service status.

Logic:
Logic used to find service status is listen port used through service 


Limitiation:
This script limited to check status of those services which are using only TCP ports.

This script will check any service using UDP ports.

This script could report some issues for services using multiple instance with sockets, Like MySQL uses same port (3306) with diffrent socket file to publish another MySQL instance. I tried to cover MySQL part, but can't commit for any other services.
